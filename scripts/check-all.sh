# scripts/land.sh runs it for you, on the merged tree, before the commit exists.

#
# The point of this file is that the local gate and the CI gate cannot drift: CI's gating jobs are
# reproduced here in the same order with the same flags. When a job changes there, change it here.
#
# WHY BOTH FEATURE SETS. This is a Leptos app: `ssr` and `hydrate` are mutually exclusive and compile
# DIFFERENT code. A change can be clean under ssr and fail to compile under hydrate — that is what
# the second block exists to catch, and running only `cargo test` would miss it entirely.
#
# The release leg is ON by default rather than opt-in, because the rule it protects is that every
# commit on main builds and passes CI by itself; a gate that skips a CI job by default cannot make
# that claim. --no-release is there for iterating, not for landing.
